# About Eventbox
EventBox is an Open Source Event Registration System(ERS) originally written and designed by Enrique M. Lacambra III and Alkino T. Ko.

There are lots of ERS that is existing now but what EventBox wants to make is to change the perpective of how people see in registering thier events and make it more useful, effective, and interactive.

EventBox is written in PHP(V 5.3.0), HTML5,CSS3, BOOTSTRAP (V 3.3) , JAVASCRIPT and uses MySQL (V 5.6) as query language.

Let us help build together a new era of ERS. :)
